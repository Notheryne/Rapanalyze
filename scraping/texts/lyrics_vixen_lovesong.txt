Have you ever wished for
Your veryown love song
Have you ever wondered
How you'd make it all alone

This is my love song to myself

Do you feel alright
Are you shinin' your light
Can we make it right
'Cause I feel it tonight

When you think it's over
You can't possibly go on
Sometimes sing it softly
Sometimes scream it loud and strong

This is my love song to myself

[Chorus]
Sayin' what you're doin'
Doin' what you're lovin'
Lovin' everybody, everybody lovin' you
You forget to love yourself
Blame it on another
Blame it on your mother
Blame it on a friend
Where will it get you in the end?

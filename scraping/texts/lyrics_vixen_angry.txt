I pretend it doesn't matter
To avoid the hell I'd catch
Deception hidden, in time
Can spark a fiery match
Once again I'm fooled
By someone that I trusted
Broken so many times
I say I'm fixed but I'm still busted

Deep inside I muss carry
All the things I feel

This pattern strains with
Every word but we will never change it
I would rather die unheard
Than speak my my mind
And take the hit
Trusting is too dangerous
I'm like the tin man rusted
Broken so many times
I say I'm fixed but I'm still busted

Deep inside I muss carry
All the things I feel

[REFRAIN:]
I'm a little angry
I may smile
But I'm a little angry

True love makes the world
Go round and round
And what you don't know
Won't hurt you (so they say)
But what about the little things
(that eat away)
That poison all your pretty thoughts
And darken all your days

All the things I feel

[REFRAIN]

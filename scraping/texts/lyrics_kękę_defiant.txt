[Prod. By Palla]

[Verse 1: KK]
I done it all man the plastic had me draped in the BAPE
Young and buckwild, you could think I had a cape
Is that your girl? Back then man we probably had a tape
Not saying to demean, showing you exactly why I ain’t fucking with the scene
Focused on living out my dreams in my reality
If normal is sane, then I’m living in insanity, splashed with a little bit of vanity
How I stay grounded when loud keeps messing ‘bout with gravity
Write my own script got a lotta folks mad I ain’t living out a tragedy
Running round raggedy
But I work like KK, stood for Kunta Kinte, but live like Cinque, free
Them scraps, them tatts; that’s me
Them suits, them books; that’s me
Them beats, them streets; that’s me
Live young, live free if you think I’ll take an L you don’t know me

[Hook: KK & ZaiiD]
Kila saa
Still in the cut and still fly
Hii ndio Dar mistari inapaa, kila mitaa
Still we try, repping the ones who in the sky
Hii ndio kazi, iko wazi, mzazi wanakaa
We defy, on the rise, on a job that we never did apply
Si nishai, hukatai, tuna nyonga mistari, nyonga tie

[Verse 2: ZaiiD]
Awali umaarufu haukua kitu nilicho fikiri
Nilicho fikiri mistari mingi kama utitiri
Nilisonga na Hip Hop no matter what, kitaa mi ndio radio noma kuwa wack
Wana wana ubora wa radio
Radio hazina ubora wa masikio
Masikio yana ubora watu sio
Wana kariri kuliko kujua ubora ndi ndio
Ah, mi na ng’ata bila ya meno
Ah, ah na nata bila maneno
Ila kila neno linakatishwa bila mayeno
Flow haiwezekani kama Tandale kuokota diamond
And I’m so serious
Baba wa taifa la rap Mwalimu Julius
ZaiiD, Kambarage Nyerere
Chama Cha Mapinduzi cha Hip Hop milele

[Hook: KK & ZaiiD]
Kila saa

[Verse 3: KK]
I live like a man that got nothing to prove
Skin the canvas with art that displays I got nothing to lose
Owe no favours I paid my dues
They call me king where I’m from don’t abide to the rules
Since I was a prince, flew the flag for KU
Middle finger to the ones who ever thought we’re through
Foundation now walks in their shoes
So I could a fuck who’s who
I could give a fuck who’s fresh
‘Cause minus the dreads, I’m Nigga 1 in the flesh
MC with a heart of a lion
Against all odds never shown no compliance
Doing what I love definition of defiance
Breathing innovation took the art to a science
All I ever needed was a lab and a microphone appliance
Did it on my own, no reliance
That’s why I stand alone as a giant, defiant

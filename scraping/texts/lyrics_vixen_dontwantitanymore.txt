Your eyes are wide open
But you can't keep your mouth shut
Every stranger's look
Like a cheap shot to the gut

You've been climbing up that ladder
Every rung is getting worse
Everyone thinks you're so
Blessed but you feel cursed

You think you want it
So you try and get it
And when you got it
You don't want it anymore

You wake up every morning
Five nineteen a.m
A man about the town Déjà vu again

Today it will be different
The only way to play
Is to break the rules if they get in the way

[Chorus]

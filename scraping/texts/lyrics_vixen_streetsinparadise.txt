Pretty people pretty cars
Living in the lap of luxury
But this precious fantasy
Seems so close when it's so far from me
Tell me where to get in line
Show me how to change my luck this time

People turn their backs on you
On the streets in paradise
When you're not the chosen few
It's hot as hell and cold as ice
Everyday's another fight
Living on the streets in paradise

Come on

All that glitters isn't gold
Promises and dreams can get so old
I know what this game's about
People chew you up and spit you out, yeah, yeah
I need some kind of a sign
Can't seem to get into this dream of mine

People turn their backs on you
On the streets in paradise
When you're not the chosen few
It's hot as hell and cold as ice
Everyday's another fight
Living on the streets in paradise

There ain't no sacrifice
That I won't make, I'll pay the price
Oh no, I won't think twice
Nothing comes cheap in paradise

Tell me where to get in line
I can't seem to get into this dream of mine

People turn their backs on you
On the streets in paradise
When you're not the chosen few
It's hot as hell and cold as ice
Everyday's another fight
Living on the streets in paradise
People turn their backs on you
When you're not the chosen few
It's hot as hell and cold as ice
Everyday's another fight
Living on the streets in paradise
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na (repeat to fade)

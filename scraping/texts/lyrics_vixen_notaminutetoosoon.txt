I was pretending it was easy alone
I built a fortress to keep out the unknown
Surrounded myself with the walls of rejection
Trapped in the dungeon for my own protection
Your smile came shining through so pure I knew

Not a minute too soon
Your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon
Your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time

Time after time I threw my heart away
My faith was fading fast day after day
I had enough of giving in
I couldn't lay down my pride
So love just pushed me aside
Your kisses washed away my thirst
Every touch felt like the first

Not a minute too soon
Your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon
Your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time

In this angry world
I thought loneliness would shelter me
My broken spirit cried in vain
Till you set me free

(Solo)

Your kisses washed away my thirst
Every touch feels just like the first

Not a minute too soon
Your love came through for me
You are the water in my desert
Not a minute too soon
Your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time
Not a minute too soon
Your love came through for me
You are the water, yeah, you are the water
Not a minute too soon
Your love got through to me
You rescued me just in the nick of time
Not a minute too soon
(Not a minute too soon) You are the water in my desert
(Not a minute too soon) You know your love came through for me, your love got through to me
(Not a minute too soon) I want you to rock me, roll me
(Not a minute too soon) I wanna be the one (to fade)

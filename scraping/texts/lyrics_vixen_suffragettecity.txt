Oh, leave me alone, you know
Oh Henry, get off the phone, I gotta
I gotta straighten my face
This mellow-thighed chick's just put my spine outta place

My school day's insane
My work's down the drain
Well, she's a total blam-blam
She said she had to squeeze it but she, and then she

Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's alright

Oh Henry, don't be unkind, go away
I can't take you this time, no way
D-droogie, don't crash here
There's only room for one and here she comes, here she comes

Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
She's alright

Oh, hit me

Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Oh, don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City

Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you can't afford the ticket
Back from Suffragette City
Don't lean on me, man
'Cause you ain't got time to check it
You know my Suffragette City
Is outta sight
Whoa, she's alright

Suffragette City
Suffragette City
I'm back from Suffragette City
I'm back from Suffragette City
Ooh, Suffragete City
Ooh, Suffragete City
Ooh-how, Sufragette City
Ooh-how, Sufragette

Ohh, wham bam, thank you, ma'am

Suffragette City
Suffragette City - Quite all right
Suffragette City - Too fine
Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette City
Oh, Suffragette

Suffragette

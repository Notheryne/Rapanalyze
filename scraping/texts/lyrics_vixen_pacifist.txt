What happened to you
It looks like you've seen a ghost
Looks like you bit your lip clear through
What happened to the friend I used to know
The gentle soul that I once knew

Are you a hero or are you a fiend
You've washed your hands
But they're still so unclean

And all those bar room brawls in Canada
I watched your pupils dilate
You never lifted a hand to anyone
What was this thing that changed your fate

As in beginning, is so in the end
Have you lost sight of yourself my friend

You said you never wanted to kill a man
You said they'd never make you fight
You said you never wanted to kill a man
The way you did tonight

You never lifted a hand to anyone
What was this thing that changed your fate

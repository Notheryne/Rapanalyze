I wanna drive you home
I wanna capture you the way you capture me
Sometimes
And I drive too fast
'cos I might as well be dead
And I wish, I wish that you were, too
Only sometimes
I try to turn these overhelming feelings into hate
Everytime I draw the line my hand begins to shake

Refrain:
So, why do I, why do I stay
You are the only face I see, you alone
I don't want you to see that
You are the only air I can breath, you alone

I talk to myself a lot
Making sure I'm still here
You manage to steal every little piece of me, sometimes
I just fall from the sky into all that is you
Funny thing that I can feel the sting
Before I hit the ground
My anger wants to sing but never seems to find a voice
You seem to have a knack for leaving me without a choice

Refrain

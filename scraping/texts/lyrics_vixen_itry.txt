I try...not to...falter
I try...not to...let you down
I try...not to...argue
I try...not to...fight with you
Try try...not to...notice
I try...not to...speak aloud

But every time that you go crazy
Knock me down you call me lazy

I try...make you...want me
I try...make you...feel so good
Try try...make you...happy
I try...make you...love me back

But every time I make you smile
You give an inch then take a mile

It makes me crazy like you
(I will get to you)
And I can't figure out what to do

But every time that you pretend to love me
You want to keep yourself so far above me

It makes me crazy like you
(I will get to you)
All this pain that you put me through
(No more pain from you)
It makes me crazy...

I try...not to...love you
I try...not to...let you go
Try try...not to...feel it
I try...not to...

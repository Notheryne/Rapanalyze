Sometimes she slips into a comma
Nothin' there but the whites of her eyes
Sometimes she tries to brush her teeth
She's busy chasing invisible flies
Well, she's a waste of a perfectly good day
And I don't wanna hear
About the little green men in her backyard
And all the shit you can fear
I don't know where she goes
She's staring into space

REFRAIN:
I thought about it
And I don't get it
How could she forget all she had
I knew her when she knew the simple truth
And I knew her when she was tangerine

Some days she wears her junior prom dress
Heads straight for the grocery-store
Buys a razor and a bottle of pills
Then can't remember what she got them for
Well, she's a waste of a perfectly good time
And I don't wanna hear
About how being swallowed by the TV
Or being pulled through a mirror
I don't know where she goes
She's staring at the stars

-REFRAIN-

Someone with something to say
She'd never throw it all away
I knew her when she was tangerine, tangerine

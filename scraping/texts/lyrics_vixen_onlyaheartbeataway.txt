The scene is set, we play the parts
Boy meets girl, better shelter our hearts
We trace the steps that a thousand lovers have danced before
Without a sound, we're face to face
And every breath is suspended in space
Every moment we're together just leaves us wanting more

Who-oh, holding back tonight, afraid of tomorrow
We both know someting's got to give
Gotta make it soul to soul, so come a little closer

We're only a heartbeat away
From laying it all on the line
We're only a heartbeat away
It is just a matter of time
So tell me that you need me (need me)
And I'll come running baby can't you see
We're only a heartbeat away

It's in the air, it's in our eyes
Burning through every cool disguise
And pretending that we don't care
Pushes us closer to each other's fire

It's too late to break the spell that encircles us
The chains of destiny are strong, stronger than both of us
Come on let's surrender

We're only a heartbeat away
From laying it all on the line
We're only a heartbeat away
It is just a matter of time
So tell me that you need me (need me)
And I'll come running baby can't you see
We're only a heartbeat away

We've been to scared of taking a fall
We're just a heartbeat away from giving our all
It's only love, only love

Holding back tonight, afraid of tomorrow
We both know someting's got to give
Gotta make it soul to soul, come on let's surrender

We're only a heartbeat away
So come on, get closer
We're only a heartbeat away, yeah, yeah
So tell me that you need me (need me)
And I'll come running baby can't you see
We're only a heartbeat away
From laying it all on the line
We're only a heartbeat away
It is just a matter of time
So baby tell me that you need me (need me)
And I'll come running baby can't you see
We're only a heartbeat away
(We're only a heartbeat away) Only a heartbeat away
(Only a heartbeat away) Yeah

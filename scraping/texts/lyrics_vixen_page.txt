This cake is half eaten
I don't remember a bite
My soul is badly beaten
And I can't remember the fight
Crawling with an open wound
Wiping the mud from my eyes
Endless guilt is kicking me
I'll never be free, 'cuz

Refrain:
I live on a page that I can't read
I live in a cage of confusion
I live on a page that can't be turned
I live in a rage everlasting

I'm slowly suffocating
Under a blanket of questions
Who am I?
Do I know me?
Am I box of suggestions?
Well, I don't know how this ends
These days we call life
Is there time to make amends
No one knows, 'cuz
-Refrain-
I've become, I've become delirious, 'cuz
-Refrain-
I live on a page
I live in a cage
I live in a rage
Everlasting

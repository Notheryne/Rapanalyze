You're looking good in your new suit
Tailor made from head to foot
Laptop always on, you got it goin' on
All the girls think that you're so cute

Honey, I can't be bought
I'm not the girl that you thought
I know what money can do
But I still won't be loving you

Emailing me with poetry
You brag about your humility
IPod always on, you got it going on
Like TV reality

Yeah, you act so cool
But I know underneath it all
You're just unsecure - who needs that?
You ain't ever gonna get me now
So give it up
Take a number
I don't need you here to set me up
I don't wanna hold your hand

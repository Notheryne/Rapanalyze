They called him crazy on the streets
Young and angry, one bad seed
He wore the colors of his call
He'd be the baddest of them all

Shoot out came down in a police raid
By a Smith&Wesson 38
At seventeen he met his fate

Fallen hero
What were you trying to prove?
Fallen hero
All you got was front page news
It's too late, tough break
Read your epitaph
Fallen hero
How many others will follow in your path?

He had a lady, now she cries alone
It would come to this, she's always known
She remembers how he used to say
There ain't no future anyway

Sirens echo in the night
Now his name is the battle cry
Of another boy who lives to die

Fallen hero
What were you trying to prove?
Fallen hero
All you got was front page news
It's too late, tough break
Read your epitaph
Fallen hero
How many others will follow in your path?

And so the story lives on
Of how his glory was won
And no lesson ever learned
Of the tragedies to come, yeah

Sirens echo in the night
Now his name is the battle cry
Of another boy who lives to die

Fallen hero
What were you trying to prove?
Fallen hero
All you got was front page news
It's too late, tough break
Read your epitaph
Fallen hero
How many others will follow, yeah
Fallen hero
Just what were you trying to prove?
Fallen hero
All you got was front page news
It's too late, tough break
Read your epitaph
Fallen hero
How many others
(Fallen hero) Fallen hero
(Fallen hero) Now his name is the battle cry
(Fallen hero) Fallen hero (to fade)

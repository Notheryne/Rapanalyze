[Zwrotka 1]
I can spit to the beat with rhymes hard as concrete
The dope shit option so you listen up closely
I'm Shane Mosley doin' microphone boxin'
Throwin' jabs, makin' raps, freestylin' and beatboxin'
Shit is toxic, need some oxygen
Who talks again that CR is a motherfuckin' champ
Hell yeah I am, so what you wanna challenge
I'm ruinin' your plan, movin fast and doin' damage
So you're untouchable, I'm watchin' and you're not
Free will or will of fortune? I want you to say it bro
Whuut? who got this fuckin' skills right now
I got skill that kill unreal faces of clowns
Blaaauw! salute like Firing Squad
Admirin' style, flyin' like a bird in the Sky
Wonder why you hate it maybe my shit is too raw
You gotta face it, the MC from eastern Europe

[Refren x2]
C - check the course, check the crowd, check these concrete cities
H - hit the hash brown, hit the philly
A - anybody who ask for help
M - makin' it perfect
Pow! The Lazy Champ

What is your motherfuckin' problem Mr.One and Only
If you're one of the skittles I'm playin' bowling
My shit is rollin' I'm creepy-crawly, keep it goin' sucker
I'm like brrra buck up! buck up! buck up!
I'm verbal torture, an erbal[?] solider, yeah I told ya
I Love the culture, the real rap exposure
Like Doujah RazeI won't just give it up
Cirap is in the place so you wack fags cut the crab
One for the money, two for the show
Three and four for my life, five and one more
Yo! what's the deal, what's up, what's coockin' dog
Nothing much, smokin' durch[?] and watch the rhyme flow
Salute! like Firing Squad
Admirin' style, flyin' like a bird in the sky
Wonder why you hate it, maybe my shit is too raw
You gotta face it, the MC from eastern Europe

[Verse]

A thousand roses

Went from red to black cuz you deaded our love

I was the best part next to you waking up

Breakfast in bed I let you eat it up

Like Folgers in your cup

Ay ay dios mio

Why why you outta focus

Lies lies caught you wide open

Your just too scared to open up


[Pre-Chorus]

Why ya play

Why ya play

Why ya playin me like 2k
You say you wanna leave you know you really really wanna stay


[Chorus]

Why you switch up

Why you switch up oh

Why you switch up

Why you switch up oh

Why you pull up

Then you switch up oh

Why you switch up

This ain't love


[Post-Chorus]

I was there before

I was showing love

On a daily

You gon make me go

You gon make me go

Crazy

Why you switch up

Act like you don't want me

Won't show no affection in public

You say I do but you don't no...

Switched it up


[Verse 2]

Back back back reverse

Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt Skrrt

Pump the brakes cuz first of all

I was your only hashtag woman crush

On a wednesday friday

Sabados lunes everyday

I was there in the hard times dark times

High tide low tide

Drip down in the summertime

Why you go


[Pre-Chorus]

Why ya play

Why ya play

Why ya playin me like 2k

You say you wanna leave you know you really really wanna stay


[Chorus]

Why you switch up

Why you switch up oh

Why you switch up

Why you switch up oh

Why you pull up

Then you switch up oh

Why you switch up

This ain't love


[Post-Chorus]

I was there before

I was showing love

On a daily

You gon make me go

You gon make me go

Crazy

Why you switch up

Act like you don't want me

Won't show no affection in public

You say I do but you don't no...

Switched it up

[Adlibs]

You took your love from me yeah

Don't take your love for me

Ohhhh yeah

Suckin' up, suckin' up to hypocrites
Sums up my days
Movin' up, backin' up
I'm like a monkey in a maze
I think a lot but then I don't remember anything
Nobody hears
And I don't even know how I got here
Here in this gray abys
Does anybody really have a chance

Refrain:
I am just a volunteer
I am not an entity
And it amazes me to tears
Alone in your machine
I'm not some faceless pawn

That you can tread upon(3rd chorus: trample on)
No more tears, alone in your machine

Cleanin' up, pickin' up your messes
Is how I survive
You pull the lever to get me started
You keep me running till I don't remember anything
'Cause I am expandable
I'm sick of livin' like today's tomorrow
And I wanna step outside
Right into never never land

Refrain

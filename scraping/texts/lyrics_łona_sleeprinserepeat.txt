Courting you around
I know all about your long day, pedal to the ground
She just sleep, rinse, and repeat

She don't wear gloves
Shakes hand with everyone she meets
She don't make love
Puts her favorite moves on repeat

The moment you arrived
I heard all about your long hair, it beat me to the ground
She just, sleep, rinse, and repeat

She don't wear gloves
Shakes hand with everyone she meets
She don't make love
Puts her favorite moves on repeat

You'd think you'd have something better to do
Than sit at home in the mirror looking at you

She don't wear gloves
Shakes hand with everyone she meets
She don't make love
Puts her favorite moves on repeat

Oohs...

These other rappers couldn’t touch me if they wanted to
I’m the realest like really who you fronting to?
I made a hundid blues
Took me like 2 days
Run up on me make you change colors like Blueface
Yeah I’ll probably go forever like Wu Tang
These kids talk behind my back I know what you saying
Yeah I do slay
I am like you times 2-8
Yeah I always win no losing
I ain’t calling no truce man
I’m coming for your neck like Mufasa
I’m chasing all this bread call it pasta
Telling me my shit it awesome
Give it 5 years and they star struck
Bout to turn these 20s into commas
Got so many bombs they be calling me atomic
Making faces red they be looking like robins
What can I say man it run through my veins
And I got so many tracks that they calling me a train
Got so many bars stored it my brain
I wouldn’t say it’s crazy
More like insane
I get that they mad cause I’m flyer than a cape
It’s my turn to eat so now please pass the plate
Y’all tryna speak but got nothing to say
Solar signing out yeah this my one take

It would be so easy, it would be so nice
If we could solve all our problems, solve 'em overnight
Everything would be so good, if everything went right

Oh baby you're just living in a fairy tale world
Thinkin' that love don't take a lot of work
You think it's all rainbows and not any rain, but it doesn't work that way

It wouldn't be love, if it didn't hurt a little now, baby
And it wouldn't be love, if you didn't have to cry sometimes
I know sometimes it ain't easy and sometimes it gets rough
But if it was any different baby, then it wouldn't be love
It wouldn't be love

So you just wanna walk out when the times get tough
If all you'll take are the good times, that's not good enough
Maybe you should come back yeah, when you're all grown up

Oh baby, you're just living in a fairy tale world
Thinkin' that love don't take a lot of work
You think it's all rainbows and not any rain, gotta be some rainy days

It wouldn't be love, if it didn't hurt a little now, baby
And it wouldn't be love, if you didn't have to cry sometimes
I know sometimes it ain't easy and sometimes it gets rough
But if it was any different baby, then it wouldn't be love
It wouldn't be love

Baby, you're just living in a fairy tale world
Thinkin' that love don't take a lot of work
If you think it's all rainbows and not any rain, it doesn't work that way

(Solo)

It's a fight sometimes

It would be so easy (it would be so easy), it would be so nice (it would be so nice)
If we could solve our problems, solve them overnight

But it wouldn't be love, if it didn't hurt a little now, baby
And it wouldn't be love, if you didn't have to cry sometimes
I know sometimes it ain't easy (it ain't easy) and sometimes it gets rough (it gets rough)
But if it was any different baby, then it wouldn't be love
If it didn't hurt a little now, baby
No, it wouldn't be love, if you didn't have to cry sometimes
I know sometimes it ain't easy (it ain't easy) and sometimes it gets rough (it gets rough)
But if it was any different baby, then it wouldn't be love
It wouldn't be love (repeats out)

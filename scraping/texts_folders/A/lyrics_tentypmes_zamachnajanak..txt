[Verse 1]
I'm a fucking walking normal man
Drinking orange Fanta straight out of a soda can
I'm a big time Yoga fan. Summer vacation
Making plans to go to France, I might go to Japan
To try to find and wine and dine Scarlett Johansson
Try to be wise, I quote Quran
Fuck Jay Leno, gotta double fucking name, it's Conan Stan
My style is boring, cause my goals are bland
Fuck rock, I'm a hip hop, and boulder fan
I stood still when you posers ran
He grip the microphone with both his hands
Just like a shotgun in the hands of an older man
When he becomes irrelevant just like a postage stamp
Their style is cheesy, while I'm mostly ham
I put you fucks in a truck, you can call me Stan
You like the bible, I'm a Moses fan!
I'm burning some trees, hearing voices chant
Fingerbang her with Royce's hand
Cause I'm a man, all you boys be damned, fuck your ploys and plans
Clark Kents change clothes and run
While I relax, put my Kryptonite in Lois' bum, fun

[Chorus]
What a pity, I'm walking through the city
Fuck me, no one's even half pretty
I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh
What a pity, I'm walking through the city
Fuck me, no one's even half pretty
I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh


[Verse 2]
I'm from Warsaw where nobody foresaw
We'd be fucked in a war when power divorced law
I shower in blood and call it a gore SPA
Mom is asking if I still do the rap thing, of course, Ma
No called one thus far, guess they think I'm subpar
Not at the studio, but another pub crawl
Don't blame me, it's your fucking Lord's fault
"No it's not". I guess I found your sore spot
Write rhymes, eyes bleeding with ink, I'm Rorschach
I'm not into fucking preachy rap-talk, so fuck Pac
Call up mister Walt White, just wait for my door knock
Crack a beer open, not smoking opium or rock
I'm not Mr. Horrorcore. I'm Mr. Voldemort in Baltimore
I'm giving you the war you've been hoping for
Fighting with Omar behind Walmart, of course it's raw
And if you're getting dizzy cause all the blood? You should focus more
Not the kind of vocal that  folks ignore
Room shakes when I open the vocal chord
I'm screaming fuck the Vatican 'till the pope is sore
Gives me my cash back, greener than the fucking Hulk and Bulbasaur
Point me to the smorgasbord, I'm get eat like an animal
Like I don't know what these forks is for
Each line is a Horcrux, boy
And each time, I gotta remind you I give no fucks, boy

[Chorus]
What a pity, I'm walking through the city
Fuck me, no one's even half pretty
I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh
What a pity, I'm walking through the city
Fuck me, no one's even half pretty
I'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh
I won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh

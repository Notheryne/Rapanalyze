[Intro]
-Can I stay a bit longer?
-Stay forever

[Zwrotka 1: Deys]
So, if the night always heals my pain
I don't want fall in different shades
Of disbelief when doubt lifts off
I took a pill for those long roads
So, if the light always hurts my veins
I don't want to bleed in a hopeless way
Some of the medicine you've left
Just a tab... fades away
There's no witness
There's no witness babe
There's no witness
There's no witness
I wish that i could bring the heat
Ice of lies will break your knees
Cold smoke seeping out of wounds that you closed
Cold smoke seeping out of wounds that you closed

[Refren x2]
Some of my sins are like shadow of the wind
Are like shadow of the wind
Are like shadow
Leave me some kind of trouble and the fever at least
Leave me some kind of trouble and the fever

[Bridge: Książe x2]
I'm so addicted and I spent a much time blacked out
You've got me trippin' and I spent a lot of time
Heating up what's froze

[Zwrotka 2: Deys]
There must be some kind of way
There must be kind of your soul
No reason to lose your breath
That's still makes no difference babe
That's still makes no difference babe
Still makes no difference babe
Still makes no difference babe
Still makes no difference babe

[Refren x2]
Some of my sins are like shadow of the wind
Are like shadow of the wind
Are like shadow
Leave me some kind of trouble and the fever at least
Leave me some kind of trouble and the fever

[Verse 1: KAEN]

Riding on this shit in Tokyo
Brandin' all these tingz in Dome
Cuba, Texas and Espana
All those nations clap at once

[Pre-Chorus: KAEN, Travis Scott]

I never knew that, girl
You're the one (straight off)
I never kept in in the secret bootle
Dropped in ocean in 95
Here you go
Just open
Let the life begin

[Hook: KAEN]
Ding Dong
Make it pop
Hawaian boy is in the ditch
Yeah, I won't tell it
If its trust is this, yeah

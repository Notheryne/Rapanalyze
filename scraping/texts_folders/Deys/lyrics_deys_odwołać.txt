I can't help but tell you how I'm feeling today
And I know there's a chance it might push you away
Well I'm fighting every urge to give you
Every little piece of myself
I can feel your need
I wanna be your sponge
I wanna kiss you again, but I don't

CHORUS :
You said you'd never say never
I know you remember
Now you're saying never
And I'm lost forever

When I'm not in control I just feel like a jerk
You made me lose myself
This doesn't happen to me
This thing is all your fault

CHORUS

You shouldn't have taken me there
Why'd you do it?
Oh, why'd you do it?
Why?

CHORUS

Never say never, forever

Hard sixteen

Daddy didn't care, mama wasn't there
Jenny slammed the door to her heart
Packed a suitcase of anger, no one tried to save her
She headed for the city that shines in the dark
But the lights fade away
When you're young on the streets without a friend
Jeanny learned to survive
Put a price on the nights that never end

She's hard sixteen
Soft to the touch but she's seen too much
She's hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry by seventeen?

The face of innocence doesn't stand a chance
Between the losers, the takers, the lost
So, Jenny never cried, locked her pain inside
She's trapped in a time bomb ready to blow
There will come a day
When the mirror reveals a total stranger
Another lonely runaway in a living hell

She's turning hard sixteen
Soft to the touch but she's seen too much
She's hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry?

Jenny please come home, please come home
You've got so much to give
So much life to live
So, come home

She's hard sixteen
Soft to the touch but she's seen too much
She's hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry?
Sixteen
Hard sixteen
Soft to the touch but she's seen too much
Hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry?
Hard sixteen
Her daddy didn't care, her mama wasn't there
Hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry?
Hard sixteen
Soft to the touch but she's seen too much
Hard sixteen
Will her soul run dry by seventeen?

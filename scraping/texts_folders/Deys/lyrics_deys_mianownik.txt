Chorus:
Life's too short to live too fast
Live & Learn
The future won't be like the past
Live & Learn

My momma told me there were better things to do
Than wonder wildly what I was to those like you
I spent a lifetime wondering what you think of me
It's never too late now I'm ready to break free

Wanna learn from my mistakes
The lessons often come too slow
A little trust is all it takes
To let it go

Chorus

You're not good for my health it's been true all along
I just can't help myself I need to carry on
This fire in my heart is making my head burn
I got a straight start but it's not too late to turn

Two steps forward one step back
The lessons often come too slow
Sometimes it's best to jump the track
And let it go

Chorus

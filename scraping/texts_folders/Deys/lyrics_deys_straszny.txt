When all is you then all is good
I reach for tomorrow
While your secrets wander into lies
And all your grace is falling out of sight

Well,I know you know
That when I look at you I can't save myself

CHORUS:
I give you peace and tranquility
You make me doubt your sincerity
But I'll hang around to be your clown
That you can push around
Well, I'll be your clown

Eloquence is hard to find
You remain protected
You criticize and apologise endlessly

I know you know
That when I look at you I can't save myself

CHORUS

I'll be your clown, your clown

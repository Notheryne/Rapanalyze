I'd like to hang you from a tree
Then make you watch what you don't wanna see
Find out what's really in your mind
Well, are you that twisted and unkind?

REFRAIN:
Shut up, shut up, words pound my head
Shut up and get off my TV set
Shut up, shut up, why aren't you dead?
Why aren't you hangin' from a tree?

I'd like to make you sit and spin
Until the lies eat through your skin
But there's no compassion in your soul
Remorse is only for yourself

-REFRAIN-

Little man with big ambition
Arrogant by self admission
I just wish the world
Could find a way to make you shut up

-REFRAIN-

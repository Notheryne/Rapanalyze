Fumblin' for a sign, searchin' for ways to find
Answers that slip from me, visibility
Wish that I could see

Somewhere inside my head, something that someone said
Whispers of mystery – my intuition speaks to me
I listen carefully
I hear a little voice
I hear a little voice

Huntin' for evidence, matter of self defense
Lookin' for clues and then it all becomes clear
I just need to hear

Asking your whereabouts, figuring it all out
Why am I wondering – why do I question myself?
Because there's no one else (there's someone else)

I hear a little voice
Callin' to me, callin' out
Cryin' out my name

Tells me everything
I refuse to see
Love may be blind but
It hears so clearly

I hear a little voice
It always sounds the same
Callin' to me, callin' out
Cryin' out my name

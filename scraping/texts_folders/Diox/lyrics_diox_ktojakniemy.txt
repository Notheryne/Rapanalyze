You don't need a special invitation
To come to the blow-out party of a nation
The big one's been set up for tonight
Wreak a little havoc till the place is a sight

No more reason to be pleasin'
Rocket blast, rock it down, rock on 10
Tomorrow might never come again

Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up
Let's have a wrecking ball - a little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball

Abandon all morality
Anything goes, got nothin' to lose but your sanity
The finger's on the button, this is your last ride
It's an "E" ticket with the devil by your side

Missiles burning, sky is turning
Grab it up, rip it hard, take a bite
You might not see the morning light

Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up
Let's have a wrecking ball - a little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball

(Solo)

Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up
Let's have a wrecking ball - a little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball
Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up
Let's have a wrecking ball - a little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up
A wrecking ball, wrecking ball - a little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall
Let's have a wrecking ball - really tear it up, yeah
A little rough and tough
This is it - last call - let's raise hell until the walls fall

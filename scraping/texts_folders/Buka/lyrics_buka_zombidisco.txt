[Verse 1]
You can do what you want
But you can't tame me at all
You see, my life is so beautiful
I got nothing to lose and I want much more

[Chorus]
I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

[Verse 2]
Say my name one more time
Give me all that I like
I don't care if it's just a mistake
It's something we both want like a birthday cake

[Pre-Chorus]
Sway me more to the floor
All my moves got you hooked
Like a spell, you know well
What's the mood, that's the mood
You need this, I need that
Hold me close to your heart
I know you want it bad

[Chorus]
I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

[Bridge]
Sway me more to the floor
All my moves got you hooked
Like a spell, you know well
What's the mood, that's the mood
You need this, I need that
Hold me close to your heart
I know you want it bad

[Chorus]
I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

I'm a hun bun bunny, but honey
I'm a fun bun honey, so lovely
I'm that hot stuff bunny, but honey
I will make you love me, boy, want me tonight

(why I never write back?)\nI remember messaging my heroes (heroes)\nFeeling like a psychopath\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow this is the season for fox huntin'\nAnd they will not stop til they got somethin'\nThis relationship got their heart jumpin'\nI'll say it now, make sure I'm not mumblin'\nI'm in love with her\nThere you go, put it in your article\nI just fell in love, doesn't mean that I'm a fool\nThey've been, uh, turning love into a carnival\nThey've been, uh, wondering if I'm honorable\nListen up though, here's the thing\nI only care what my momma and my sister think\nFuck going online, that ain't part of my day\nAnd they been lying non stop, so you'd click the link\n\n[Chorus]\nI don't like that (hey, hey)\nI don't really like that (hey, hey)\nI remember messaging my idols\nHoping that they write back\nBut they never write back\nWhy they never write back?\n(Why they never write back?)\nI remember teasing my demons\nHoping that they bite back, argh!\nI don't like that\nI don't really like that\nNow I got these kids in my DMs (DMs)\nBegging me to write back\nI don't write back (I don't write back)\nWhy I never write back? (why I never write back?)\nI remember messaging my heroes (heroes)\nFeeling like a psychopath\n\n[Outro: Cold War, dir.

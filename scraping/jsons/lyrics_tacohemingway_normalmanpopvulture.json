Summer vacation\nMaking plans to go to France, I might go to Japan\nTo try to find and wine and dine Scarlett Johansson\nTry to be wise, I quote Quran\nFuck Jay Leno, gotta double fucking name, it's Conan Stan\nMy style is boring, cause my goals are bland\nFuck rock, I'm a hip hop, and boulder fan\nI stood still when you posers ran\nHe grip the microphone with both his hands\nJust like a shotgun in the hands of an older man\nWhen he becomes irrelevant just like a postage stamp\nTheir style is cheesy, while I'm mostly ham\nI put you fucks in a truck, you can call me Stan\nYou like the bible, I'm a Moses fan!\nI'm burning some trees, hearing voices chant\nFingerbang her with Royce's hand\nCause I'm a man, all you boys be damned, fuck your ploys and plans\nClark Kents change clothes and run\nWhile I relax, put my Kryptonite in Lois' bum, fun\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat a pity, I'm walking through the city\nFuck me, no one's even half pretty\nI'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh\nI won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh\nWhat a pity, I'm walking through the city\nFuck me, no one's even half pretty\nI'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh\nI won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh\n\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm from Warsaw where nobody foresaw\nWe'd be fucked in a war when power divorced law\nI shower in blood and call it a gore SPA\nMom is asking if I still do the rap thing, of course, Ma\nNo called one thus far, guess they think I'm subpar\nNot at the studio, but another pub crawl\nDon't blame me, it's your fucking Lord's fault\n\"No it's not\". I guess I found your sore spot\nWrite rhymes, eyes bleeding with ink, I'm Rorschach\nI'm not into fucking preachy rap-talk, so fuck Pac\nCall up mister Walt White, just wait for my door knock\nCrack a beer open, not smoking opium or rock\nI'm not Mr. Horrorcore. I'm Mr. Voldemort in Baltimore\nI'm giving you the war you've been hoping for\nFighting with Omar behind Walmart, of course it's raw\nAnd if you're getting dizzy cause all the blood? You should focus more\nNot the kind of vocal that  folks ignore\nRoom shakes when I open the vocal chord\nI'm screaming fuck the Vatican 'till the pope is sore\nGives me my cash back, greener than the fucking Hulk and Bulbasaur\nPoint me to the smorgasbord, I'm get eat like an animal\nLike I don't know what these forks is for\nEach line is a Horcrux, boy\nAnd each time, I gotta remind you I give no fucks, boy\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat a pity, I'm walking through the city\nFuck me, no one's even half pretty\nI'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh\nI won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh\nWhat a pity, I'm walking through the city\nFuck me, no one's even half pretty\nI'm acting silly, ugh, my name's Filip, ugh\nI won't stop until I make a couple millis, ugh", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b8ab5bd93fe1981b27e5e4c87febb7.847x847x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taco Hemingway"}

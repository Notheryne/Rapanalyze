(Young Hems what the dealy?)\nGoddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)\nGoddamn it, now. My name isn't Taco, you know, my name is Filip\n\nVerse 1:\nSitting on a porch chair, today I just don't care\nGrab my friend's phone, \"hey, do you have any porn there\"?\nOverheard by female passerbys, there goes that long stare\nFuck ya'll bitches and glowing hair\nFuck your shoes and your gear, pierced boobs and your ears\nFuck your blues and your chop'n'screws and your rocking rolls\nMy genre is indie-folk-low-fi-post-weird\nI'm beloved and ignored, most loved and most feared\nI'm a white European boy, best believe it boy\nSo much \"weird\" in my lyrics that I'll never be employed\nLatest ploy, rape Freud with a phallic-shaped toy\nAsk him for analysis, while my phallus is showing\nNever been rich or piss-poor. Is it wrong?\nAlways low self-esteem, like \"what'd I get that kiss for?\"\nAnd then my ego exploded. Explode\nSuddenly feeling like God when he's blowing his load\nOn the face of his favorite pope, screaming: \"baby choke\"\nThen he's sucking on a blunt laced with his favorite dope\nScreaming, quote: \"Fuck Africa. I'm gonna leave'em broke\nWhole world is a pile of fucking dirt, semen soaked\"\n(Goddamnit, now)\nOh, yes indeed. Funny how he never say these things in press release\nI'm hungry. Not rap-wise, hungry for Lebanese\nAnd instead saying grace, I will be resting in peace, goddamn it now\n\n\nChorus:\nGoddamn it, now\nI just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now\nGimme me a trampoline, give me a tambourin\nRed wine, blueberries and a gram of green\nGoddamn it now. Goddamn it now\nI just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now\nGimme me a trampoline and a tambourin\nRed wine blueberries and a gram of green\nGoddamn it, now\n\nVerse 2:\nYoung Hems, what the dealy?\nMy name isn't Taco, you know, my name is Filip\nAnd I'm from a town that's been burned to the ground\nThat's why I'm never down, 'less you stab my achilles\nI think I'm Big Meech and Bronsonelli\nFuck the crowd in the mouth, get your tonsils ready\nI'm rocking Wilma's bed and locking jaws with Betty\nI'm 'bout to spit the vomit on y'all. Mom's spaghetti\nInvited to Biggie's house and his parties are heavy\nI tried to carpool but I couldn't get my balls in the Chevy\nI got there late but I still shook some hands and got me a bevy\nAnd Biggie's asking me why I'm no longer rapping as FV\nBecause of Hopsin, I told him\nNow I rapping with a name from FIFA manager mode\nOh, and I'm a Yiddo. Hungry like a hippo\nKeep your lips closed, kid or I'll damage your folks\nParty on, yeah, the bitches were big fun\nBut I'm in the kitchen eating freaking chicken with Big Pun\nHe wants the last piece, he's licking his damn teeth\nI'm saying like \"aight, peace\", but I grab it and make a run\n\"Son, I beg your pardon!\"\nWhen I'm hungry I got Bronson fronting steak with garlic\nThen we're having fondue or whatever you call it\nI woke up in my apartment, a half-dead alcoholic\n\nBridge:\nGoddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)\nX2\n\nChorus:\nGoddamn it, now\nI just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now\nGimme me a trampoline, give me a tambourin\nRed wine, blueberries and a gram of green\nGoddamn it, now. Goddamn, it now\nI just wanna lie in a motherfucking hammock now\nGimme me a trampoline and a tambourin\nRed wine blueberries and a gram of green\n\nOutro:\nGoddamn it, now. (Young Hems what the dealy?)\nX3\nAnd I'm from a town that's been burned to the ground\nThat's why I'm never down, 'less you stab my achilles", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b8ab5bd93fe1981b27e5e4c87febb7.847x847x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taco Hemingway"}

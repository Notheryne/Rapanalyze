Call me Chewbacca\nI don't want to listen any Chuck, give me some Waka\n\"JFK\" kind of flopped, I blame it on Jimmy Hoffa\nIt\u2019s a race, I'm a big fat rat like Mickey's poppa\nFuck the race, I\u2019ve been in the back. Sharpen the teeth. I'm skinning you cats\nRunning the game, going up in the chain and I will harassing your bitches in fact\nH.E.M.I.N.G.W. A.Y, is that fucking dude bugging you, huh?\nMr. Hemingway coming through, ugh. Earning my bucks, who the fuck are you\nRolling me in Bohan, going bowling with Roman\nBellic it's getting hectic but, check it, I come from Poland\nI'm blowing up in London, there's only one thing that I'm hoping\nI wanna get a fucking feature from Sweden, shout-outs to Young Lean\nShout-outs to Pauline, uhm, I was just wondering\nIf you wanna get married, \"goddamn it, Filip, you're drunk again\"\nWake up next day, head broke again. Trying to roll a cigarette, man, fuck the wind\nNo cash, cause I spent most of it. Was it even worth it, man, it must've been\n\nChorus:\nI'm Chewbacca. Crossbow, top shotta\nI'm Chewbacca on these bombaclots\nI'm Chewbaca. Crossbow at the copper\nWhat am I doing? I just drank a lot\nI'm screaming:\nGoddamn. You motherfucker, you\nX3\n\nVerse 2:\nI'm Chewie, see, put the Louie in Louis V\nAnd I'm saying shout-outs to C.K, he's saying like \"who is he\"?\nWhen I was seventeen on a rooftop in BK, I truly dreamed\nOf becoming a freaking MC, I'm rapping now, holy shit\nThese rappers annoying\nMe and the mic, like Chandler and Joey\nLook at my balls, they're dangling, boy\nI'm marrying Perry and strangling Zoey\nYou fuckers are cute\nFeeling like Biggie so gimme the loot\nFuck all your parties and popping the mollies\nMy mommy just  brought up some broccoli soup\nAll you blind fucks is Mrs Patmore\nPeep this, how 'bout you tweet less and rap more\nJeez. If I was rich like Croesus and Macklemore\nI think that I would buy me a dream at Yeezy's rap store\nMaybe like a bottle of wine\nOr two, three, four, you know I think a dozen is fine\nA pack of cigarettes, you know I haven't smoked for some time\nI got a message from a fan, fuck it, I'm not replying\nYou know why? 'I'm a diva. Fuck rap, playing FIFA\nI do a show fuck off to Tenerifa\nAll you fuckers eat your hearts out like Khaleesi's beef\nI plant the seed in the game like I harvest Amber Khalifa\n\nChorus:\nI'm Chewbacca. Crossbow, top shotta\nI'm Chewbacca on these bombaclots\nI'm Chewbaca. Crossbow at the copper\nWhat am I doing? I just drank a lot\nI'm screaming:\n\"Goddamn. You motherfucker, you!\"\nX3\n\nVerse 3:\nDrink something and I'm a Wookie\nOnly though my only mixtape flopped, I'm not a rookie\nI can almost hear hateful your thoughts like I was Sookie\nDo a Vik, bet the dead guy will win, go call your bookie\nEarl flow, and the lips kinda fat, I'm not as ugly\nFace always IDGAF, like I was Droopy\nStole the thunder, got banned, got back I got a new key\n'Finna start a fucking cool ass cult, like Captain Murphy\nTaco Hems, go and run tell your friends, I'm out-this-worldly\nCancerous, like the Lump is my Kin, shout out to Lurleen\nAre you late for the Sweatshirt wagon? Well, I'm kind of Early\nBut I bet it's gonna be full soon, you better hurry\nYoung Hems, known for lung flex\nRhymes bursting out compulsive like writing a dumb text\nI will break your self-esteem after breaking your chums' necks\nShow up at your show drunk and befriending your mum's ex, Taco", "image": "https://images.genius.com/66b8ab5bd93fe1981b27e5e4c87febb7.847x847x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Taco Hemingway"}
